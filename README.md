## Introduction

<a href="https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs"><img width="230px" src="https://cdn.virgilsecurity.com/assets/images/github/logos/virgil-logo-red.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"></a> [Virgil Security](https://virgilsecurity.com) provides the E3Kit which simplifies work with Virgil Cloud and presents an easy-to-use API for adding a security layer to any application. In a few simple steps you can add end-to-end encryption with multidevice and group channels support.

The E3Kit allows developers to get up and running with Virgil API quickly and add full end-to-end security to their existing digital solutions to become HIPAA and GDPR compliant and more.

## Features

- Strong end-to-end encryption with authorization
- One-to-one and group encryption
- Files and stream encryption
- Recovery features for secret keys
- Strong secret keys storage, integration with Keychain
- Integration with any CPaaS providers like Nexmo, Firebase, Twilio, PubNub, etc.
- Public keys cache features
- Access encrypted data from multiple user devices
- Easy setup and integration into new or existing projects
-  One-to-one channel with perfect forward secrecy using the Double Ratchet algorithm

## About the Flutter implementation

Virgil E3Kit for Flutter is a wrapper of [E3Kit for Swift/Objective-C](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-e3kit-x) and [E3Kit for Android](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-e3kit-kotlin) done via [Platform Channels](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels). Click the links to see details about the underlying implementations.

## Installation

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  e3kit:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/cardoso/virgil-e3kit-flutter.git
```

In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:e3kit/e3kit.dart';
```

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online [documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Usage Examples

#### Register user
Use the following lines of code to authenticate user.

```dart
import 'package:e3kit/e3kit.dart';

// initialize E3Kit
final eThree = await EThree.init(identity, tokenCallback);
    
await eThree.register();
```

#### Encrypt & decrypt

Virgil E3Kit lets you use a user's Private Key and their Card to sign, then encrypt text.

```dart
import 'package:e3kit/e3kit.dart';

// TODO: init and register user (see Register User)

// prepare a message
final messageToEncrypt = "Hello, Alice and Den!"

// Search user's Cards to encrypt for
final users = await eThree.findUsers(['Alice', 'Den']);
final encryptedMessage = await eThree.encrypt(messageToEncrypt, users);
```

Decrypt and verify the signed & encrypted data using sender's public key and receiver's private key:

```dart
import 'package:e3kit/e3kit.dart';

// TODO: init and register user (see Register User)

// Find user
final users = await eThree.findUsers([bobUID]);
    
// Decrypt text and verify if it was really written by Bob
final originText = await eThree.decrypt(encryptedText, users[bobUID]);
```

#### Multidevice support

In order to enable multidevice support you need to backup Private Key. It will be encrypted with [BrainKey](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-pythia-x) generated from password and sent to Virgil Cloud.

```dart
await eThree.backupPrivateKey(userPassword)
```

After the private key is backed up you can use `restorePrivateKey` to load and decrypt the Private Key from Virgil Cloud.

```dart
await eThree.restorePrivateKey(userPassword)
```
